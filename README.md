## PROJECT SUMMARY

Apollo search application is designed for small kids who can easily use a mobile phone. Once the user clicks on the image, they can see different variants of the selected image. This feature aims to attract the user by creating artistic and interesting photos using automated machine learning algorithms. This will eventually increase the user's interest in space-related technology. We not only use classical computer vision algorithms, but we also use state-of-the-art algorithms such as DALL-E and stable diffusion to convert the image. Due to the time limit, we are unable to add more features.


We have developed an Android application using Android SDK. The backend of the application is written using Python and it uses Machine learning, Deep learning, and Computer Vision algorithms.





We create innovative, interesting, artistic images using automated algorithms. The purpose of this project is to attract the user by creating different images which are derived from the selected image.



User Story: The user will open the application and search for an image. One user has selected an image then the user will open the detail page to see the image, title, description, and keywords. From this screen, the user will be able to select multiple filters to see the effects on the image. If the user wants to share the image then the user can click on the share button to share it with friends via social media.



## Technology Stack:



### Mobile application:

We have developed a mobile application using Android SDK. This mobile application is connected with our Python application using REST API.



### Python Backend:

The backend of the application is developed using python, and Fastapi. It's deployed on AWS and it uses many other services where the machine learning models are deployed. We use Computer vision and deep learning algorithms to automatically generate the images. We also use the recent state-of-the-art algorithm DALL-E and Stable diffusion.
